Terms of Service
================

 If you intend to use OpenRouteService in your own applications please contact us. We are interested in spreading the usage of OpenRouteService in academic and non-profit projects.
Commercial usage of the services provided by OpenRouteService does need approval!
When accessing, requesting and using OpenRouteService and the provided APIs, depending on your daily amount of API requests and regardless of the consumer's legal entity or legal body, we distinguish between three different types of usage:

- Single End Use 
  You are distinct single end user, i.e., an actual human being that can access OpenRouteService and the provided web services with up to 2500 requests per day free of charge. In case the server performance will be affected, we reserve us the right to limit individual service user. You may not redistribute hosted API services, nor may you permit your end user to redistribute hosted APIs, including by proxying or any other method to not avoid directly accessing our APIs. If you want to make use of the Services outside this description or should you intend to further use our services commercially (without any limit restriction), please consider a Commercial/ Enterprise Use.
- Commercial/ Enterprise Use
  You are planning a commercial use of OpenRouteService and the provided Routing/Direction and Accessibility API with more than 2500 requests per day in total, either consumed by a single end-user or multiple seats, in a private or commercial application. In order to cover the expenses of used resources and to support further ORS enhancements in the future, we charge you a yearly license service fee. In this case you may redistribute hosted API services, and permit your end user to use and access our hosted APIs in any commercial application. Please contact openrouteservice@geog.uni-heidelberg.de to get an individual quote.
- Public funded Institution/ NGO
  You are planning to use OpenRouteService the provided APIs with more than 2500 requests per day in total, either consumed by a single end-user or multiple seats, in a private or commercial application as a publicly funded institution or NGO. In this case we offer reduced fares and would charge you according to the amount of requests you send to our service in order to cover expenses. Please contact openrouteservice@geog.uni-heidelberg.de to get an individual quote.

Copyright and use of our Services
When using the OpenRouteService APIs or using any other service provided by OpenRouteService make sure to have the copyright text "© Powered by OpenRouteService" in your API Implementation, site, or other propert(ies) (either displayed in the map image itself or elsewhere).

Usage Limits
If you exceed the usage limits as a free Single End User (2500 requests per day) of a given OpenRouteService API, the API will return an error message. If you repeatedly exceed the limits, your access to the API may be temporarily blocked. In this case we will inform and contact you about our Commercial/Enterprise Use. You can exceed the usage limits for the OpenRouteService APIs by:
- Sending too many requests per day
- Sending requests too fast, i.e. too many requests per second
- Sending requests too fast for too long or otherwise abusing the web service

Service Limitations
OpenRouteService always ensure to only publish stable releases of the provided API services. The chosen parameter, e.g. mode of transportation, avoid features, number of waypoints for Routing and isochrones time and isochrones interval for Accessibility Analysis affect the overall performance and calculation time, which may vary. Due to individual routing graph profiles for every mode of transport, the update process and the performance/computation time of route results also varies.

Change of terms or services
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time by posting the changed terms on the site. All changes shall be effective immediately upon posting. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services after we post of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of the new terms. We may change the features and functions of the Services, including APIs, and the terms of this license agreement may change over time. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you makes to the Services are compatible with then-current OpenRouteService APIs. We will endeavor to avoid changes to our APIs that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you prior to implementation.
