<p>If you intend to use OpenRouteService in your own applications please contact us. We are interested in spreading the usage of OpenRouteService in academic and non-profit projects.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial usage of the services provided by OpenRouteService does need approval!</strong>
When accessing, requesting and using OpenRouteService and the provided APIs, depending on your daily amount of API requests and regardless of the consumer&#8217;s legal entity or legal body, we distinguish between three different types of usage:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Single End Use</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first last">You are distinct single end user, i.e., an actual human being that can access OpenRouteService and the provided web services with up to 2500 requests per day free of charge. In case the server performance will be affected, we reserve us the right to limit individual service user. You may not redistribute hosted API services, nor may you permit your end user to redistribute hosted APIs, including by proxying or any other method to not avoid directly accessing our APIs. If you want to make use of the Services outside this description or should you intend to further use our services commercially (without any limit restriction), please consider a Commercial/ Enterprise Use.</p>

In this case you may redistribute hosted API services, and permit your end user to use and access our hosted APIs in any commercial application.

<h2>Usage Limits<a class="headerlink" href="#usage-limits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you exceed the usage limits as a free Single End User (2500 requests per day) of a given OpenRouteService API, the API will return an error message. If you repeatedly exceed the limits, your access to the API may be temporarily blocked. In this case we will inform and contact you about our Commercial/Enterprise Use. You can exceed the usage limits for the OpenRouteService APIs by:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Sending too many requests per day</li>
<li>Sending requests too fast, i.e. too many requests per second</li>

<h2>Service Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#service-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenRouteService always ensure to only publish stable releases of the provided API services. The chosen parameter, e.g. mode of transportation, avoid features, number of waypoints for Routing and isochrones time and isochrones interval for Accessibility Analysis affect the overall performance and calculation time, which may vary. Due to individual routing graph profiles for every mode of transport, the update process and the performance/computation time of route results also varies.</p>
